# NodeJS ExpressJS and MongoDB Notes


## JS - was meant to run only in the browser

Following are some JS engines that are present in modern day browser to run JavaScript:

Google Chrome - V8 Engine.
Mozilla Firefox - SpiderMonkey.

Node was developed by Ryan Dahl to run JS outside of the browser.

Node = V8 Engine/SpiderMonkey + Inbuilt Node Modules

Node is a Runtime environment, that allows JS to run outside of browsers in local machines as well.

Now lets see some quick examples to understand this concept of runtime environment:

Playstation games can run in a play station console only.
I can make tandoori roti in a tandoor only.


### CJS

//for importing

const x = require("module")

//for exporting
module.exports = x

Common JS method is used to import or export any Node module.

We are not using ES6 method of importing and exporting because almost all the industries in the market use the CJS method only, and we have to align with the same as most of the resources present on web also prefers the same.

### Node REPL

Read â‡’ Evaluate â‡’ Print â‡’ Loop

Explore this by your own, Do Experiments.

#### JavaScript isâ€¦.

Single Threaded.
Asynchronous.
Dynamically Typed.
Concurrent.
`
Note: Go through the Documentation of node as well, and experiment yourself,
specially try some of the inbuilt node modules.



## Interaction with system

There are two methods by which we can interact with the system/machine/computer:

## GUI â‡’ Graphical User Interface

ðŸ’¡ This is the pretty common way that we use to interact with the system, that includes taking the help of graphics to demonstrate and visualise all the actions that we are doing.

## CLI â‡’ Command Line Interface
ðŸ’¡ This kind of interaction mainly involves writing specific commands to perform any kind of operation in the system.

### Common CLI commands

Please explore the following CLI commands, they are really fun:

1. ls Directory Listing
2. ls -al                     Formatted listing with hidden files
3. ls -lt                     Sorting the Formatted listing by the time modyfication 
4. cd dir                     Change directory to dir.
5. cd                         Change to home directory.
6. pwd                        Show current working directory.
7. mkdir dir                  Creating a directory dir.
8. cat >file                  Places the standard input into the file.
9. more file                  Output the contents of the file.
10. head file                 Output the first 10 lines of the file.
11. tail file                 Output the last 10 lines of the file.
12. tail -f file              Output the contents of file as it grows, starting with the last 10 lines.
13. touch file                Create  or update file.
14. rm file                   Deleting the file.
15. rm -r dir                 Deleting the directory
16. rm -r file                Force to remove the file 
17. rm -rf dir                Force to remove the directory dir.
18. cp file1 file2            Copy the contents of file1 to file2.
19. cp -r dir1 dir2           Copy dir1 to dir2; Create dir2 if not present.
20. mv file1 file2            Rename or move file1 to file2, if file2 is an existing directory.




### External Node Modules

These are also called as third party libraries, as they are written by someone else and we can directly use them in our project.

Install is-even package using npm .
Play around with it as we did in the session to understand the concept.
You can install any other package as well and plat around with it.


#### Start with the project

ðŸ’¡ Do all the following things using CLI only.


* Create a node project.
* Create a index.js file.
* Create a text.txt file.
* Write some content inside the file.
* Use nodeâ€™s inbuilt module fs to read the content of file and print them to the console.
    * readFile :- This will read the file asynchronously.

const fs=require("fs")

fs.readFile("./text.txt",{encoding:"utf-8"},(err,data)=>{

if(err){

console.log("Cannot read the file")

console.log(err)

} else {

console.log(data)
}

})

console.log("Bye Guys!!")

* readFileSync :- This will read the file synchronously, until the file reading is not finished, compiler is not going to the Bye Guys!! statement.

const fs=require("fs")

const data=fs.readFileSync("./text.txt",{encoding:"utf-8"})

console.log(data)

console.log("Bye Guys!!")


* Write into a file using the fs module again.
* While writing it will automatically create the file.

* writeFile :- This will write the file asynchronously.

const fs=require("fs")

fs.writeFile("./log.txt", "This is me first time wrinting in the file", (err)=>{

if(err){

console.log("Cannot write in the file")

console.log(err)

} else {

console.log("Data has been written in the file")

}

})


* writeFileSync :- This will write the file synchronously, first the writing will be finished then the next task.

const fs=require("fs")

fs.writeFileSync("./log.txt", "This is me second time wrinting in the file")

writeFile will overwrite the previous content of the file.

Notes 3
So try appendFile to overcome this.

const fs=require("fs")
fs.appendFile("./log.txt", "\nThis is me third time wrinting in the file\n",(err)=>{
if(err){
console.log("Cannot be appended")
console.log(err)
} else {
console.log("Data has been appended in the file")
}
})

There is  appendFileSync as well, it works in the same as  readFileSync and  writeFileSync .
